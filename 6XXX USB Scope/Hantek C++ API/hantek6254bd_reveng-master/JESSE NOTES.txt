had to add libs:
C:\Projects\Test Equipment\hantek6254bd_reveng-master\hantek6254bd_reveng-master\SDK\LIb
(from hantek API)

Had to add .dll files to output folder:
C:\Projects\Test Equipment\hantek6254bd_reveng-master\hantek6254bd_reveng-master\x64\Debug\
HTHardDll.dll
HTSoftDll.dll
MeasDll.dll
HTDisplayDll.dll
(I used the 64 bit ones but I kept the .dll that came with the repo which is different (smaller) than the x64 one in the hantek API)
